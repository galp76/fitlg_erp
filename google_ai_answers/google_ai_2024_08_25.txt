I am starting to work in an ERP app focused on smartphones, which should be my first module (sales, purchases, products, etx) and why?

Here's a breakdown of the most logical first module to focus on when building an ERP app for smartphones, along with the reasoning:

The Ideal First Module: Products

Why Products are the Foundation:

    Core Data: Products are the fundamental building block of any ERP system. They form the foundation for sales, purchases, inventory, and more.

    Universal Application: Regardless of the specific industry, every business deals with products in some form. It's a universally relevant module.

    Data Integrity: Getting the product database accurate and robust early on ensures data consistency throughout the entire ERP.

    Building Blocks for Other Modules: Once you have a solid product module, you can build upon it for other essential parts of the ERP.

Why Other Modules Might Not Be the Best Starting Point:

    Sales: Sales are heavily dependent on products. Without a defined product catalog, creating sales orders or managing customers becomes difficult.

    Purchases: Like sales, purchases require a clear product structure to track supplier information, costs, and inventory.

    Inventory: While inventory is closely linked to products, it's often more complex and requires sophisticated tracking. It's best to have a solid product foundation before tackling inventory management.

Steps for Building a Solid Products Module:

    Product Information:

        Product Name

        SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)

        Product Categories

        Descriptions

        Images

        Pricing (cost, retail, discounts)

        Unit of Measure (pieces, kilograms, etc.)

    Product Attributes:

        Size, Color, Material, Model, Features, etc. These are dependent on your industry and product types.

    Product Variants:

        If you have different variations of the same product (e.g., a shirt in various sizes and colors), ensure your system can handle these effectively.

Key Considerations for a Smartphone ERP:

    Mobile-First Design: Prioritize a user interface (UI) that's intuitive and easy to use on smaller screens.

    Offline Functionality: Ensure users can access and work with product data even when they don't have an internet connection.

    Data Synchronization: Develop a robust method for synchronizing product data between the mobile app and any cloud-based ERP system you're integrating with.

Next Steps After the Product Module:

    Purchases: Tracking product acquisition from suppliers.

    Inventory: Managing stock levels, tracking movements, and issuing alerts.

    Sales: Creating sales orders, generating invoices, and managing customer relationships.

Remember, this is a strategic approach. Your specific needs will dictate the order and priority of modules. It's always advisable to start with the most fundamental and impactful element, which is often your products.
